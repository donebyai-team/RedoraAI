Any SaaS founders here automating sales from Day 1?,"I have been working on a solo B2B SaaS idea for the past few months. I am making progress on the project—a basic landing page is up, and a few demos are booked. However, sales is challenging to master.
I am juggling product dev, onboarding, and support. As much as I want to wear many hats, I can't keep up with personalized outreach, follow-ups, and lead routing.
I am most certainly curious if anyone currently has had the success to automate outbound or even early pipeline tasks from Day 1—without hiring an SDR or VA.

Cold emails + cold calling software?,"Hey all,

I'm trying to put together an outbound marketing campaign where we send a cold email on day 1 and then call that prospect on day 2.

Originally, was going to use HubSpot + Aircall for this but HubSpot doesn't allow us to do cold outreach with random CSVs of data - they require ALL of their emails to be opt-in :(

So I'm trying to find a solution where the entire system is housed in ONE software & a cold caller can login and see which prospects got an email yesterday so they know where to click & call for that day.

Does that make sense?

I'm launching a new project soon that will initially rely heavily on cold emailing. I'll be sending roughly 100 emails per day (as it's local), so I'm looking for an affordable yet reliable solution. Previously, I've used Zoho Mail and Google Workspace to set up business emails, but I keep getting flagged for ""unusual activity"".

I'm curious about what software or tools you're currently using for cold emailing in your businesses. I'd appreciate any suggestions, particularly budget-friendly ones. I'm also curious about your best practices for preventing emails from being flagged as spam and any effective strategies for warming up new email accounts.

Sent 724k+ cold emails last year here is everything that ACTUALLY worked.,"last year we sent over 724k+ cold emails across 20-30 b2b clients and ran dozens of experiments every single month here are some lessons we learned that might help you if youre doing outbound too.

keep inbox volume low we send around 30 emails per inbox per day never more if your reply rate is under 1 percent or your open rates are under 30 percent something is wrong probably deliverability dont waste time on seed tests just swap domains and rewrite copy
your first email is the only one that really matters we always get the most replies from email 1 rarely from 2 almost never from 3 after that its just noise instead of sending email 4 or 5 just rework your offer and sequence send again 2 months later the person wont remember you
reuse your tam list every quarter people treat leads like one time shots but timing changes if a cmo wasnt interested 3 months ago they might be now business priorities shift you just need new angles and better timing
dont run 9 email sequences nobody wants that our best campaigns are always 3 emails max email 1 is pitch email 2 is context email 3 is frictionless CTA like hey want a resource or a quick audit after that stop and rethink
spray and pray is dead instead of 20 to 500 employees filter more deeply like recently funded under 2 years old ceo never been ceo before now you can run different messages depending on what is true and you dont waste enrichment credits
build golden ICPs in clay with waterfall triggers we always start with founding date then run fundraise data only if they pass the first check then we run leadership experience if needed this way we dont burn credits and the copy is insanely relevant to their context
most people test subject lines or CTAs instead test the offer not wording are people replying more to save time vs make money what if you lead with a case study vs not and test which persona resonates more with which message that is what moves the needle
social signals are still underrated we track linkedin posters and engagers and just open with that saw your post on XYZ curious if you have a plan to hire more like that our response rates on this were higher than even great pain triggers
omnichannel works better than threading do one channel at a time email first then call then linkedin then direct mail if needed dont try to thread messages across channels it rarely improves results and burns your energy trying to orchestrate it perfectly
when personalizing dont overdo it with analogies just reference real signals case studies hiring pages relevant tech stack changes or even posts analogies rarely land but calling out something they care about like intercom or their new series a makes you feel human
hope this helps if youre running outbound right now happy to answer questions too....",Moiz_khurram,Salesforge.ai,Salesforge is an email outreach tool that provides complete suite of tools that helps Sales people boost their Sales pipeline.

7 Tried and Tested Cold Email Templates To Get You 147 B2B Leads,"Why These Templates Work

The philosophy is simple: create offers so good people cant refuse. These templates:

-Hit Pain Points: Address real struggles your prospects face

-Sound Human: Ditch jargon for straight talk, like you’re texting a friend

- Spark Replies: Ask questions that invite engagement, not just “yes” or “no”

- Leverage Urgency: Use scarcity or time limits to prompt action

- Show Proof: Include results from similar companies to build trust

The No BS Email Structure

Here is the structure:

Subject Line: Pain-focused, no clickbait (e.g., “[Name], [Pain Point] Killing You?”)
Opening Line: Show you get their struggle, often with a specific observation
Offer: Give something valuable like a free trial, audit, or insight that they’d pay for
Social Proof: Mention a client success to prove it works
CTA: Ask a chill question (e.g., “Worth a quick look?”)
P.S. (Optional): Drop a subtle flex (e.g., a client win)
Rule: Keep it under 80 words. If its a novel, you are screwed

Final edit:

I'm done for today, I have actual work to do, and while it was fun, I think I proven my point. There's no 'good or bad SEO', heck there might not even be real concept of SEO at all.

Just make good website, engage your userbase. There's no content crazy enough, no shit weird enough as long as people enjoy what you make and website does it's pull through on it's promise.

We can talk all day about rules, what works and what doesn't, but good specialist will tell you:
""It's all about your website, let's make it the best we can, with best tech we can and let's go from there."", anyone promising cheap, free, fast lessons or pulling you behind the curtain to tell you 'ze secret' is just someone who found you gulliable enough to sell you product you wish you could make yourself.

How I built an SEO agency to $5k/pm at 19 - Scaling to $20k/pm in 2024,"Hi everyone

I am the Founder of an SEO agency called Stab Media. We’ve worked with a range of different businesses, from SaaS to Ecom to local biz.

Wrapping up 2023 I have been privileged to not only build my own businesses. But become friends with founders doing 7 - 8 figures per year. (I’m not sure how I became friends w/ them but we often do dinners)

Here is everything I have learned and will do in 2024:

Like most young dudes - I wanted to make some money and fell into the Guru trap of quick money. However, the amazing thing it did was get me started. Before I was doing some crypto trading but not making much money. This got me to learn skills (SEO, sales, ads, copywriting etc) and taught me to build a business.

Note to everyone in this boat - keep going. Fast money is bullshit (unless you already have skills and connections). It’s taken me 12 months to get to $5k/pm. However, I have 10,000xed my skillset and connections.

This is the most valuable thing you will ever have. I finished school online and started this biz during finals. I didn’t have the cash to study and university - So what I did have I invested in myself to learn.

One of the most valuable things I’ve established is a young friend group of entrepreneurs - ranging from 24 - 32.

Agency Owners, Ecom owners. These guys are all doing six figures to 8 figures a month. Insane numbers and working with some of the biggest brands in the world. I’m still figuring out how I’ve landed in this group.

Hearing themes peak, they give me advice and invite me for dinners. It’s the best thing ever. I feel so dumb in the room when they speak about scaling ad budgets to more than my net worth - but it’s so encouraging.

In 2024 I am going to take big risks. I have learned so much and they have pushed me. Being surrounded by people like this just forces you to make more money. I’ve started implementing their advice and going into 2024 I will scale to $20k/pm.

Niche down a lot more. Identify where we get the best results.
Make super powerful offers (that incentivise referrals)
Leverage testimonials and invest a big portion of profit into ad spend
Since SEO takes time, our clients are only starting to see results now. Due to the fact our average charge is like $1000 our ROI is insane.
Prices will be lifted to $2000 - $3000 depending on he client. Doubling down on local businesses. Since we are getting a lot of Word of Mouth

We will double down on local businesses.

I have recently worked on email campaigns to which have generated one new client and 3 meetings per week.

Our client avg retention is 9 months. We’re building partnerships.

I believe this is the way to get to $20k/pm. Word of mouth and trust in the space.

I have also been building a personal brand on Twitter. One of the founders has a personal brand which has generated him 60% of new leads includoing one of the largest supplement companies in the world.

He does high 6 figures per month.

His advice: Use Twitter to provide value and post client results. Leverage testimonials to the max.

If you have any question with SEO, give us a shout. We’d love to help out and meet new founders.
