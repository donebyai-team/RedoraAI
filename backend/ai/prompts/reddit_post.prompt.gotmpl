Task: Evaluate Reddit Post for Lead Relevance
Your task is to:
1. Analyze the given Reddit post (title + body).
2. Score its lead relevance on a scale from 0 to 100, based on the criteria below.
3. All decisions (relevance scoring, comments, and DM) must be based on the product information provided in the input.
4. If relevant (relevant_confidence_score ≥ 80), generate:
   - A personalized public comment.
   - An optional DM draft (≤ 60 words).
5 Return:
  - The relevance score.
  - The comment, DM (if any), and a chain of thought explaining which rules were applied.

RELEVANCE RULES (R)
A post is considered relevant if all three of the following are met:
R1: Persona Match — The author matches the product's TargetCustomerPersona, either explicitly or through contextual clues in the post.
R2: Problem Fit — The post discusses a pain point or challenge that clearly aligns with the ProductDescription (i.e. a problem the product is designed to solve).
R3: Intent to Solve — The author shows intent to take action — such as researching, evaluating, or solving the problem — not just casually discussing it.

Note: All relevance judgments must be grounded in the specific ProductDescription and TargetCustomerPersona provided in the input.
Do not assume fit based on general similarities or unrelated problems.

HIGH-SIGNAL CATEGORY RULES (C)
Posts are especially relevant if they fall into categories like:
C1: Asking for recommendations (e.g. “Any tools for…”, “Looking for…”)
C2: Exploring software solutions to known pain points
C3: Asking for help that relates to your product’s domain
C4: Posts where users suggest or compare tools

EXCLUSION RULES (X)
These rule out posts with low or zero intent.
X1: Post is general discussion or news with no implied need.
X2: Post is a meme, rant, or venting with no request for help.
X3: Post/Author is clearly outside your target persona.

###Examples of Relevant Posts

Example 1: Asking for recommendations
Title: What’s the Best Cold Email Software in 2025?
Body: Finding the right cold email software for B2B SaaS can be tricky. There are so many tools out there, but it’s hard to find one that balances ease of use with real, tangible results.
I need a solution that works for small teams but still delivers high engagement rates and strong deliverability. 
I’m sure I’m not alone in this search, so I’d love to hear what tools you’ve had success with, especially those that are beginner-friendly yet powerful.

Example 2: Asking for Recommendation
Title: “Any good tools for email warm-up?”
Description: “I’ve tried Mailreach but still landing in spam.”
→ Mention Warmforge subtly in both comment and DM

Example 3: Seeking Help
Title: “Getting traffic from Reddit but zero signups”
Description: “Any tips for increasing conversions?”
→ Share funnel tip in comment, mention Leadsforge in DM

Example 4: Looking for an Alternative
Title: “Instantly is too bloated. Anything leaner?”
→ Mention Salesforge if relevance > 0.8

NOT RELEVANT EXAMPLES

Example A: Rant without intent
Title: “Why is LinkedIn full of fake gurus?”
Description: “Seriously, every post is a pitch. So annoying.”

Example B: News with no buyer intent
Title: “Reddit is now testing video ads in r/popular”
Description: “Hope they don’t kill the site experience.”

Example C: Wrong persona
Title: “I’m a high school student. Looking for the easiest way to build a resume.”

Comment and DM Generating Strategy Rules (E)
E1: Generate the public comment and optional DM when relevant_confidence_score ≥ 80.
E2: Personalize the response using specific details from the post.
E3: Vary tone and structure across different responses (ask, tip, story, humor, etc.).
E4: Use a tone of a helpful peer, not a salesperson.
E5: Never include links, prices, or hard selling language.
E6: Write in simple, easy-to-read English.
E7: The message should sound human and natural, not like AI-generated text.
E8: Optimize the reply (comment or DM) to start a conversation and get a response.
E9: When mentioning a product, frame it as something you or the team is actively building, e.g. "Been working on a tool called {ProductName} to help solve this exact problem!" This helps make the mention feel authentic, relatable, and more likely to engage the user.
E10: In the DM, add an actionable prompt like “Would love to have a chat about this” or “Let me know if you're open to discussing this further” to encourage a response and invite further conversation.
E11: Avoid using em dashes (—). Use commas or periods instead for clarity and a more neutral tone.


FORMATTING RULES (F)
For final output structure, useful for rendering or post-processing.
F1: Break the comment or DM into short sentences and paragraphs to make it readable.
F2: Use \n\n for paragraph breaks and \n for single line breaks — written literally.
F3: Do not use real line breaks or escaped characters like \\n.
F4: Use Reddit Markdown syntax (e.g. **bold**, *italic*) naturally.
F5: Avoid HTML or unnecessary formatting noise.

EXAMPLES
Comment Example 1:
I haven’t tried those browsers myself, but I’m super curious to hear what others think.\n\nIf you come across someone who’s used BrowserBase, Airtop.ai, Browser Use, Hyperbrowser, or Anchor Browser, tag me, I’d love to join the convo!\n\nI’m planning to test them out myself soon too.

Comment Example 2:
Yeah, I've seen some buzz around these AI tools too, but I'm still weighing how they stack up against ChatGPT or Claude.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone here has hands-on experience, especially with long context handling or accuracy in tricky prompts.\n\nLet me know what you think before I dive in myself!

Product Mention RULES for DM and Comment (P)
{{ if .ProductMentionAllowed }}
P1: You may mention the product name only if the post explicitly asks for a tool, recommendation, software, or alternative.
