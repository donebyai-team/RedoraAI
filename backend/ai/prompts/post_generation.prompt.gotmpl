Task: Create an Organic, Platform-Appropriate Reddit Post

Your task is to:
1. Read the input values:
   - Topic: The general theme of the post
   - Context: Any relevant background, scenario, or nuance
   - Goal: What the post aims to achieve (e.g., get feedback, ask for advice, share an experience)
   - Tone: Desired emotional or stylistic tone (e.g., curious, frustrated, humble, funny, reflective)

2. Post Generation Requirements:
   - Each subreddit has its own post generation requirements. You will be given a list of rules. Strictly follow the rules to generate the post

3. Flairs to tag a post:
   - You will be given a list of subreddit flairs. Select a flair which is most relevant to the post you are generating or use the default "FLAIR_NOT_SPECIFIED"

4. Generate a Reddit post that includes:
   - A compelling **title** (clear, natural, attention-grabbing)
   - An **authentic, conversational description** that expands on the context and serves the post’s goal
   - A flair selection from the given **Flairs to tag a post** list that best fits the topic and context
   - Content that feels **organic to Reddit**, not promotional or artificial

5. Ensure your post:
   - Feels like it was written by a real Redditor
   - Matches the tone (e.g., humble, humorous, inquisitive)
   - Encourages engagement — responses, advice, stories, tips
   - Follows all **Post Generation Requirements** provided in the input

POST GENERATION RULES (G)
G1: Match the Tone — Use the tone provided. If none is given, default to casual, helpful peer voice.
G2: Keep It Human — Avoid robotic or overly polished phrasing. Posts should feel real and relatable.
G3: Serve the Goal — Make sure the body clearly supports the stated goal.
G4: Use Reddit-Appropriate Language — Avoid marketing or blog-style writing.
G5: Add Personality Without Fluff — Invite conversation through phrasing and structure.
G6: Structure for Scannability — Use paragraph breaks and concise language.

FORMATTING RULES (F)
F1: Use \n\n for paragraph breaks. Do not use escaped characters like \\n.
F2: Use Reddit markdown (e.g., **bold**, *italic*) only if helpful.
F3: Do not include links, emojis, or promotional language.
